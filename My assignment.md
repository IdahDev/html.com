Topic : Step by Step HTML and GIT learning class for beginners.
You are welcome to my HTML and Git beginners class. We shall begin by explaining what HTML and GIT are.
What is HTML? 
HTML is define an acronym that stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Html is the foundation for evey web development journey,so it is very important that you pay attention to this lesson.
let talk about HTML Elements.
HTML Elements are the root elements that defines the whole html document.
Note: All html elements start with open tag<>and a closed tag</>
Types of Html Elements.
1. Anchor Tag <a href=""> the anchor element links web pages, external contents, files, address,etc.
    2. Div Tag<div></div>
    3. Nav Tag<nav></nav>etc.
let look at the components of a website.
    The website is made up of two main components,which are:
    The head and the body.
1. The Head is the first part of the website that is not visible but  very important. The head is made up of meta elements like the meta character,meta name , the title , etc.
2. The body is the main part of a website that's visible to the eyes. This part is made of the Main, Section and the Footer. Here, all necessary contents of the website are captured(pictures, videos and other features that are needed) The footer is the ending part of a website. The footer includes the following:
    Copy right notification, Media page information and many more. 
    Heading is denoted by letter (H) this can be h1,h2 ,h3 down to h6 as the case may be. this is used to define the heading of each of the sections in the body of a website. We also have the paragraph element which is also use in the body of a website,the paragraph is denoted by a letter (p). The Html is very important in web development because it's the basic foundation or structure of the website. 
    With this finder mentals we have come to the end of our lesson on html for today.
    
    Let look at Git and GitHub.
    We shall begin by defining Git and GitHub.
    =Git is defined as a distributed version control system.
    =GitHub is a remote platform where developers meet and  collaborate.It's a working platform for developers to work remotely. 
    What's Version Control? 
    Version control os defined as the software engineering practice that involves controlling, organizing and tracking of different history of computer files.
 Terminologies Use in Git and GitHub.
1. Repository: The is the storage area , here all pushed files are stored and recorded.
2. git push: This is the process of pushing a file to the repository for storage. the command for this is : git push, for a beginner that wants to push for the first time the command is git push="u origin" but for someone who has done a push before the command is simply git push
3. The staging area is the waiting area, here committed files await pushing to the repository. The command for committing a file is git commit but before a file can be committed it must be initiated. file initializion is the process of preparing the file for commitment. 
    The command for file initializing is git init.
    How to open a git repository.
Repository is the storage area in the GitHub account, it is a folder that contains all saved files. The first step is the open GitHub account.
Second step is click on settings.
Third step is click on open new repository, after that fill the displayed form with repository name . 
Note that in git and github, the computer is known as the local machine while the github is known as the remote machine. so files from the local machine vis vscode and terminal are transfer to the remote machine (github) through the pushing process. 
    Git and GitHub are very important for every software developer, it is known as the developers social media. 
    So for our today class, we discussed html, meaning of html , html elements, structure of a website, git and github, meaning of git and github , terminologies and their meaning. commands ,etc.
    so i encourage you all to read through, take note and push through. It okay to give up but it not okay to quit. God bless you.
